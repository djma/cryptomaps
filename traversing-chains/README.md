# Traversing Blockchains

In the olden days, blockchains were few and disconnected. The only way to move across chains was to enter the dark realm of centralized exchanges.

Over time, enlightened heros worked day and night to build bridges between those chains. That allowed us to bypass the dark realm.

_Woah! Hold up before you cross a bridge!_

You must carry with you the **native token** of your destination. Otherwise you will be powerless in the new dimension. Frozen. Be wary not to run out of the native token.

I have put together a rough map of my explorations. It isn't complete. No map is ever complete. In fact, a good map *omits* details that may confuse the traveler! Though if you find new and fertile lands, please help expanding the map.

Enough talk. I hope my map serves you well fellow degen. Safe travels.
